# Release 5: Cleaning up the front end


### Learning Competencies

  - Understand how to implement a HTML/CSS codebase from a wireframe
  - Understand how to write DRY CSS code
  - Understand how to work with vendor assets

### Summary

  With the back-end functionality intact, its time to clean up the front-end. You'll be writing a clean, professional HTML and CSS skin for your site.

  [You'll be working off wireframes for your three views.](wireframes.pdf) While writing this codebase, focus on the following:

  ***Separating structure from skin.*** All attributes related to positioning and layout (display, position, float, etc. ) should be separated from attributes related to decoration (background, font-size, font-family, etc.). Ideally, your structure-related CSS will be stored in a separate file than your skin-related CSS.

  ***Separating container from content.*** Your styles should not rely on elements being nested within each other, so they can be easily reused and moved.

  ***Keeping your CSS DRY.*** Can you reuse CSS classes and HTML components? Can you limit the length and complexity of your CSS codebase?

  You will also be using icons from an external vendor for your upvote and downvote buttons -- in this case, from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).
